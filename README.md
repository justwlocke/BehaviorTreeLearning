# BehaviorTreeLearning
A repository where I mess around with PandaBT to see what I can make.


This project was originally forked from Mike Sellers' "Town Test" repo, during a class on Advanced AI Topics

You can find it here:

Commit forked from: 8b288b0cc3a386552be848a6271b7a797b66a18a

# ------------------------------
Important commits I made after the fork, whose data was "lost" in the transition between my student repo and this one.
#
"Wrote a whole bunch of code for things (agents) entering and exiting buildings based on what time of day it is, but didn't quite finish it in time before class ended."

"Enabled sleeping in people, fixed them not disappearing entirely when entering a building, and reordered everything in the scene view heirarchy so that the waypoints are next to the buildings they represent"

"Implemented the farmer's functionality as an inherited class of the normal worker"

"Made lots of private things in the default Panda script protected"

"Fixed a bug when inspecting someone as they go to bed"
